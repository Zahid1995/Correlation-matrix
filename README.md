# Correlation-matrix
Correlation matrix and heat map to choose the least correlated indices. 
Import the given correlation.py file to a new project and complete the required libraries download.
upload the file that contains remote sensing indices e.g., vegetation indices, to check the correlation between them. 
The heat map will mark the least correlated indices.
The number of least correlated indices can be set, in addition, a threshold can be defined e.g., 0.9 etc.
